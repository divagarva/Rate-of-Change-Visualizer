# Rate-of-Change-Visualizer
 This Python project, "Rate of Change Visualizer," calculates and visually represents the rate of change (slope) between two points on a graph. It uses user inputs for coordinates, computes the slope, and plots the points and connecting line using matplotlib, making math concepts easy to grasp.
